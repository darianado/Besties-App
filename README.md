# Besties

A cross platform (Android and iOS) mobile app for finding friends. It is inspired by the way Tinder allows users to meet new dates, but Besties comes up with something new - matching users with people that share the same interests. Our recommendation system helps users to find the most compatible profiles by showing them on the feed.

## Deployed version
The software is deployed as ".app" (iOS) and ".apk" (Android) files, which can be run directly on a simulator. These files can be found in the "builds" folder of the submission. Instructions on running and creating these files can be found in the report, or in the "README.txt" file found in the "builds" folder of the submission.

To use the iOS version:
1. Start an iOS simulator. We recommend using 'iOS 15.4 iPhone 13'. Others may work.
2. On the Home Screen of the open simulator, drag and drop the "Besties.app" file.
3. The app is now installed and can be opened like any other.

To use the Android version:
1. Start an Android simulator. We recommend using 'Pixel 3a'. Both arm64 and x86 architectures work.
2. On the Home Screen of the open simulator, drag and drop the "Besties.apk" file.
3. The app is now installed and can be opened like any other.
