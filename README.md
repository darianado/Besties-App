# Besties

A cross platform (Android and iOS) mobile app for finding friends. It is inspired by the way Tinder allows users to meet new dates, but Besties comes up with something new - matching users with people that share the same interests. Our recommendation system helps users to find the most compatible profiles by showing them on the feed.
